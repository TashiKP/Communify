# React Native Project: Communify

This project was bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Project Description

**Communify** is a smart communication assistance app designed for speech-impaired individuals in Bhutan. It supports both Dzongkha and English languages, offering features like Text-to-Speech (TTS), symbol-based communication, and culturally relevant symbol libraries. The app aims to bridge communication gaps, promote inclusion, and provide support for families and caregivers. Developed using AI and machine learning, Communify ensures accessibility, security, and customization to meet diverse user needs.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Ensure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Start **Metro**, the JavaScript bundler for React Native, by running the following command in the project root:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
Step 2: Start Your Application
With Metro running in its own terminal, open a new terminal in the project root and use the following commands:

For Android

# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
For iOS

# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
This will launch the app in the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator, assuming the emulator/simulator is set up correctly.

Alternatively, you can run the app via Android Studio or Xcode.

Step 3: Modify Your App
Open App.tsx in your editor and make changes.
Use the following shortcuts to reload:
Android: Press R twice or open the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>) and select "Reload".
iOS: Press <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in the iOS Simulator.
